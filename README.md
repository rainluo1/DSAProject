# Data Structures & Algorithms Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms portfolio! This repository contains a series of projects developed for one of my classes, where I implemented, analyzed, and documented various data structures and algorithms.

## Overview

In this portfolio, you will find projects that include:

- **Linked List**: Implementation and analysis of linked list operations.
- **Hashmap**: Creation of a custom hashmap with runtime analysis.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Implementation of the shortest path algorithm with performance insights.
- **Trees**: Exploration and implementation of different tree data structures, along with design decisions and runtime comparisons.

Each project includes:
- **Runtime Analysis**: Detailed analysis of algorithm performance.
- **Design Justifications**: Reports explaining the design choices and trade-offs for each implementation.

## How to Navigate

- **Project Folders**: Each project is contained in its own folder with source code, reports, and analysis.
- **Documentation**: Detailed readmes and reports in each folder provide insight into the design decisions and performance metrics.

## Getting Started

To get started with any project:
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/rainluo1/DSAProject.git
